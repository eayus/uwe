# uwe
Uwe, a purely functional package manager written in the dependently typed Idris.

Inspired by Nix and Guix, Uwe explores using a typed language for derivations and configuration. Dependency misconfiguration is a type error. I plan to extend this to a whole operating system (like NixOS, GuixSD) but that is still a long way off.

Not usable currently.
